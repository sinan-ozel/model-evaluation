# 🚀 Model Evaluation

This repository empowers you to seamlessly evaluate machine learning models. Here’s what you can achieve:

✨ Capabilities:

1. 🖥️ **Local Models** – Evaluate models running on your machine.
2. 🌐 **Public Models** – Test models available online.
3. 🏗️ **Production-Ready** – Run evaluations in a containerized, pytest-friendly workflow, making it easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

# ⚙️ Dependencies

1. 🐳 **Docker** – Required for running evaluations locally in isolated containers.
2. 💻 **VS Code** (Optional) – Use VS Code tasks to simplify commands and workflow.
3. 🔗 **GitHub** – Skip local setup entirely; run evaluations automatically on GitHub Actions.

# 🎓 Required Knowledge

1. 🧪 `pytest` (on 🐍 Python, obviously)
2. 🐳 Docker, but just setting environmental variables on `docker-compose.yaml` based on the existing example should be enough.


# Locally-run Example

To run the example, I am using a GPU with 6GB memory. It is pretty old, so almost anyone with a graphic adapter should be able to run this locally.
